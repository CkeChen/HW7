    <h1>History of Racing Video Games</h1>
    <div>A racing video game is a genre of video games, either in the first-person or third-person perspective, in which the player join in a racing competition with any type of land, air, or sea vehicles. In general, they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore simulations, and simpler arcade racing games. Racing games may also fall under the category of sports games.

Atari’s space race in 1973 could be considered as the first racing games. It was a space-themed arcade game where players controlled spaceships that race against opposing ships, while avoiding comets and meteors. The game was controlled using a two-way joystick, and was presented in black and white graphic. Monaco GP, released by Sega in 1979, improved upon previous overhead-view racing games with a vertically scrolling view and color graphics. Another notable video game from the 1970s was The Driver, a racing-action game released by Kasco, that used 16 mm film to project full motion video on screen, though its gameplay had limited interaction, requiring the player to match their steering wheel, gas pedal and brakes with movements shown on screen, much like the sequences in later laserdisc video games.

In 1980, Namco’s overhead-view driving game Rally-X was the first game to feature background music, and allowed scrolling in multiple directions, both vertical and horizontal, and it was possible to pull the screen quickly in either direction. It also featured an early example of a radar, to show the rally car’s location on the map. Pole Position, the most influential racing game was released in 1982. It was the first game to be based on a real racing circuit, and the first to feature a qualifying lap, where the player needs to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. Pole Position established the conventions of the genre and its success inspired numerous imitators. Pole Position II was released in 1983 and featured improvements, such as giving the player the choice of different race courses as well as more colorful landscapes lined with advertising bill-boards.
